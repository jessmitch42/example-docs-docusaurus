# Technical writer take-home assignment

Please refer to `assignment.md` for assignment details.

## A note on privacy

I have intentionally left out the name of the company this assignment is for to make it less discoverable for other candidates while the repo is public. I will make the repo private once it has been reviewed.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Deployment

This app is currently deployed at [https://jmitchell-tech-writer-assignment.netlify.app/](https://jmitchell-tech-writer-assignment.netlify.app/).

All assignment requirements are answered within the website's UI to avoid the reader needing to refer to source code directly.
