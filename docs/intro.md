# REST API Introduction

## Overview

Use this REST API to create, update, and list ad creatives, as well as to generate status reports.

> ðŸ’¡ These are example docs for a technical assignment and do not represent a usable REST API.

### What is an ad creative?

"Ad creative" refers to the the visual, audio, or text-based elements of an advertisement.

These can include (but are not limited to):

- images
- animations
- text
- videos

_Note: For the purpose of these example docs, we'll limit ad creatives to these four types._

## Usage

To use this REST API, developers can make requests to the `https://api.adcreative.com/v1/` base URL. HTTPS is required for all API requests.

To learn more about how to use each endpoint that is currently available, see the [Endpoints](./category/endpoints) section.

### Supported endpoints

The following endpoints are publicly available to developers.

| HTTP method | Endpoint                                                         |

Ad creatives are represented in this API by the "Ad creative object". Retrieved ad creatives will be returned using this structure.
